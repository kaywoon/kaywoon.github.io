    <h1> My Instant Noodle Recipes </h1>
    <p> Throughout my time of cooking at home, I have came up with various instant ramen recipes. Here are three of them that I would like to share! All of them are modified viral ramen recipes from the internet which I took inspiration from. </p>

    <h2> 1. Kujirai Ramen</h2>
    <h3> Ingredients for Kujirai Ramen</h3>
    <ul> 
        <li>korean ramen (i used jin ramen but you can use shin) </li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 piece of sliced cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Steps: </h3>
    <ol> 
        <li> In a pan, add around 300ml of water and bring it to a boil</li>
        <li> Put in the noodle block, and flip it when the bottom side gets soft</li>
        <li> Once the noodles are 3/4 cooked, drain most of the water</li>
        <li> Add in the dried vegetable pack and half the seasoning pack, and mix it</li>
